# @superfleb/vue-color-picker

A Vue component for choosing colors with a nice big rainbow and HSL(A) and RGB(A) selection.

# Status
_This is still a work very much in progress. Some parts are missing, untested, or incomplete._

## Done/Works

- Selection from sliders, numeric text inputs, and point-and-click
- Color preview with alpha
- Alpha on/off option
- Related swatches
- Light- and dark-mode supported

## To-do/Broken/Wanna-do

- De-jank Firefox
- Tests, and all the bugs they'll find
- Verify that it can be imported as a package, and make it one.
- An option to specify the input/output format
- "#" input for hex codes is not implemented (at all-- it's just a disconnected textbox)
- Draggable point-and-click (color changes on drag, not just complete click)
- Options to specify which sliders/inputs to show or not show
- A proper README, package releases, all that stuff.
